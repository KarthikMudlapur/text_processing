# NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (text_processing)
A Natural Language Processing model for customer reviews of a restaurant.

Natural Language Processing (or NLP) is applying Machine Learning models to text and language. Teaching machines to understand what is said in spoken and written word is the focus of Natural Language Processing.

Steps to be carried out:

1. Clean texts to prepare them for the Machine Learning models,
2. Create a Bag of Words model,
3. Apply Machine Learning models onto this Bag of Worlds model.

In this example, based on customer reviews of a restaurant we classify if the review is good or bad with 73% accuracy of the model.
